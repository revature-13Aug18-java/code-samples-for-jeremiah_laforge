<p>
RideForce is a full-stack <strong>Microservice</strong> application that was developed in a full team enviroment in which my role was team lead. The matching service provides the ability to sort users in relation to other users by comparing distance, end date of training, work start time, and a rating determined by liking or disliking an other user. Goals were trakced with Trello to manage our Agile Development process. We worked together to achieve the following goals:
<ul>
<li>
   Implement testing for all lines of code - achieved 77% coverage  
</li>
<li>
    Updated Documentation using JavaDocs to create thorough code 
</li>
<li>
    Refactor matching algorithm to match a builder design pattern
</li>
<li>
    Added handling for changes made by other services
</li>
<li>
    Added handling for new field "start time" in algorithm
</li>
<li>
    Implemented Hystrix to manage fallback for calls to other services
</li>
</ul>
