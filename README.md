In this repository the code that I wrote while working at revature can be viewed. <br> <>
Project Zero and Project One were both developed without teamwork, while Projects Two and Three <br>
were completed in team enviroments. Due to this the second and third projects only contain files<br>
that were created or modified by me.<br>
</p>
<p>
Project Zero is a command line interface that mocks a banking app written using <strong>Java</strong> connected to an <strong>Oracle DataBase</strong> using <strong>JDBC.</strong><br>

Project One is a full stack reimbursement system built using <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong> Bootstrap</strong> to create views and <strong>JavaSCript</strong> to make <strong>AJAX</strong> calls to a <strong>Java</strong> back end using <strong>Servlets</strong> to manage the requests, and <strong>JDBC</strong> to connect to an <strong>Oracle DataBase.</strong><br>

Project Two is a full stack single page   built using <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong> Bootstrap</strong> to create views and <strong>JavaSCript</strong> to make <strong>AJAX</strong> calls to a <strong>Java</strong> back end using <strong>Servlets</strong> to manage the requests, and <strong>JDBC</strong> to connect to an <strong>Oracle DataBase.</strong><br>
