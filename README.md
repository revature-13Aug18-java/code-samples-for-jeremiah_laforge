# code-samples-for-jeremiah_laforge
In this repository the code that I wrote while working at revature can be viewed. <br> 
Project Zero and Project One were both developed without teamwork, while Projects Two and Three <br>
were completed in team enviroments. Due to this the second and third projects only contain files<br>
that were created or modified by me.<br>
<br>
Project Zero is a command line interface that mocks a banking app written using <strong>Java</strong> connected to a <strong>Oracle DataBase</strong> using <strong>JDBC.</strong><br>
