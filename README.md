<h4>In this repository the code that I wrote while working at Revature can be viewed.</h4> 
Project Zero and Project One were both developed without teamwork, while Projects Two and Three 
were completed in team environments. Due to this, the second and third projects contain only files
that were created or modified by me.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Project Zero is a command line interface that mocks a banking app written using <strong>Java</strong> connected to an <strong>Oracle Data Base</strong> using <strong>JDBC.</strong></li>

<li>Project One is a full-stack reimbursement website built using <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong> Bootstrap</strong> to create views and <strong>JavaScript</strong> to make <strong>AJAX</strong> calls to a <strong>Java</strong> back end that uses <strong>Servlets</strong> to manage the requests, and <strong>JDBC</strong> to connect to an <strong>Oracle Data Base.</strong></li>

<li>Project Two is a full-stack single page application that allows users to retrieve and saves recipes. It was developed in a small team utilizing <strong>Agile</strong> principles to manage our collaboration and leveraging both <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong> Bootstrap</strong> to create the client side and a <strong>Java</strong> back end using <strong>Spring MVC</strong> to implement a <strong>RESTful API.</strong></li>

<li>Project Three is a full-stack single page application developed in a team environment utilizing <strong>Agile</strong> principles to manage our collaboration between teams working on different services where we leveraged <strong>Spring Boot</strong> <strong>Spring Cloud Netflix</strong> to develope and manage multiple services.</li>
</ul>
